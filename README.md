## 🛠️ Suggested Enhancements

Here are ideas to expand this repository over time:

- Add CSS/HTML separation: move JavaScript into `.js` files instead of embedding in HTML.
- Include more advanced topics: Promises, async/await, closures, ES6 modules.
- Add unit tests (e.g. Jest or Mocha) for functions you write.
- Create a folder structure: `basic/`, `intermediate/`, `advanced/`.
- Provide readouts / documentation inside each file.
- Build small interactive demos (on-page UI, not only console logs).
